# Mock File Download Tool
A tool to help with testing applications, you give options and it will produce you a file to be downloaded.

You can specify a filename, content, content type and additional response headers.

Don't want to post? Got you covered.  You can also go;

<code>/CreateFile/{filename}/{file content}/{content type}</code>

Also has continous deployment based on changes from GitHub, thank you Azure Web Apps

See it in action @ [mockfiledownloadtool.azurewebsites.net](http://mockfiledownloadtool.azurewebsites.net/).

### RoadMap?

I've already forgotten I've written this.

But if you'd like some more features then tap me up or do it a pull request.
